# Running Ham

Hi everyone!

This project is about the internet of things and how we can start making simple things that can make us understand how fast are the technologies developing that can make that futuristic thing become reality.

I love my hamster, was a gift of the creator of the [original running ham](http://www.instructables.com/id/RunningHam-Palace-Online-Hamsters/), with the challenge to make ir running again. I have been working on it and I have found out an easier way to do it using Particle Photon, and I want to share it with everyone.

All the info at [my website](http://www.josebaegia.eu/running-ham/) or at [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Running-Ham-Palace-V2/)
